This has been a pretty shitty year and sometimes it feels like the prelude to an even shittier next few decades. The United States faces almost unprecedented inequality and the whole world is dealing with the initial consequences of climate change, a process we're still accelerating. At the same time other forms of ecological and social pillaging continue with no end in sight.  

This might seem like a weird way to start a post about optimism and solutioons, but this post is only conditionally optimistic. It's optimistic _if_ we can fix the United States' political and cultural dysfunctions. And that's a pretty big if. It may seem like some of these solutions will happen no matter what, simply because they're more profitable ways of doing things, but we need additonal government focus in solving these problems now, and a reactionary or stuck government not only won't lead progress and change, it might actively hamper it(For example, through [oil subsidies]()). And of course, the solutions to problems like inequality and housing shortages are predicated on functioning state and federal governments that care about their citizens.

But if we get good political outcomes, if Ossoff and Warnock win Georgia, if progressives and the left get more power in the Democratic party, if more saints like [Stacey Abrams]() and [Ben Wikler]() can set up get-out-the-vote machines in other states, for local as well as federal elections, if Scott Weiner and other [pro-housing]() politicians in California see success, if even just enough of those things happen, we have many causes for optimism.  

That's because the colossal problems we face aren't intractable. Not even close. This post is primarily a collection of solutions to the problems that we face as a country and a planet, primarily ecological and climate change related solutions, but welfare and inequality focused solutions as well.  

Think of this post like the bit from the Simpsons where Homer covers up the sign that says "Don't forget. you're here forever" with pictures of his daughter so that it says "do it for her." Where "it" is fighting the much, much harder political fights that need to be fought so we can enact the solutions we have.

<h1>Agriculture</h1>
The initial inspiration for this post came to me months ago from a [thread](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1273338423055704064) by [Dr. Sara Taber](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww) on "well managed wild game/fisheries." It turns out that managing "wild" herds of animals or salmon runs could provide so much more food and remove cities' dependency on rural areas for food. This could greatly reduce agricultural pollution as well.  

The most amazing part of all of this is that it isn't even necessarily a solution that we need to do a lot of intense research on to figure out how to use properly. It was done by Native Americans for thousands of years! And are still doing it!  

Obviously the world would be a better place if we all became vegans, but if demand for meat is going to continue, we might as well try to make it more sustainable. That's where this next solution comes into play. Livestock contributes to [14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221209631730027X). Luckily, a [study a few years back](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652619321559) found that feeding cows seaweed reduces their methane emissions 67%!  

This massive reduction could be world-changing if enough seaweed can be sourced. Luckily even that logistics problem has a solution. [Research is being conducted](https://civileats.com/2019/06/03/can-we-grow-enough-seaweed-to-help-cows-fight-climate-change/) in both researching the most efficient ways to grow large amounts of seaweed, an already cost effective and low impact because it doesn't require feed and can clean the water, and on finding alternatives. I highly reccomend taking a closer look at the last article I just linked for more details.  

Interestingly, farmers in 18th century Iceland and Ancient Greece [grazed their cows on beaches](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-eating-seaweed-can-help-cows-to-belch-less-methane). Since methane is a sign of inefficiency in a cow's digestive system, farmers might even embrace the use of seaweed additives in cow feed.  

The bulk of the solutions in this article will be like these: anything from completely new ways of thinking about how we take care of and use our resources to unexpected discoveries that while not a total shift of approach can still have a massive impact.

<h1>Electricity</h1>
I finally got the motivation to write this post after some of [Noah Smith's](https://twitter.com/noahpinion) posting and [writing](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s) on technological progress and [renewables](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-im-so-excited-about-solar-and). The thing that struck me the most was how crazy cheap solar energy had gotten. The price of solar energy has [fallen 82% since 2010](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/06/03/solar-costs-have-fallen-82-since-2010/#:~:text=The%20levelized%20cost%20of%20energy,the%20International%20Renewable%20Energy%20Agency.) and is [cheaper than natural gas and coal](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth) at the astounidngly low price of $40/MWh as of 2019. At the same time batteries are getting better and better, both in terms of incremental improvements and, as Smith puts it in his article: "[new fundamental advances](https://www.wired.com/story/quantumscape-solid-state-battery/)"  

Solar Power isn't the only contender for green energy production, and both solar and energy storage have drawbacks in the need to extract enough resources needed to make all the panels and batteries. [David Roberts]() has written about the potential of [geothermal energy](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical) and while there are still engineering problems that stand in the way of fully unleasing the potential of geothermal, those solutions appear to be completely solvable.  

If solar and geothermal aren't to your liking, or simply aren't enough, there's always the incredibly powerful, and contrary to popular belief(thanks Matt Groenig), very safe, nuclear power. Modern reactor designs, generally known as [generation IV reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor), but including specific designs like [molten salt fast reactors](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.59)(MSFRs) which are easy to build and operate, have an effectively eternal fuel cycle, and produce easy to manage the waste. This is my personal favorite form of renewable energy, but it would require large amounts of initial investment and a "massive paradigm shift" in how the United States' nuclear power industry's approach and focuses.  

Another advanced nuclear reactor design, albeit one that isn't fully fleshed out yet, is the Traveling Wave Reactor(TWR) or "Generation IV, liquid sodium-cooled fast reactor" design from Bill Gates-back company [Terrapower](https://www.terrapower.com/our-work/traveling-wave-reactor-technology/). This reactor operates at atmospheric pressure, making it significantly safer and will be able to utilize fuel made from depleted uranium, reducing fuel supply issues and limiting the possiblity of proliferation. Terrapower's TWR design isn't fully complete, but they've had success with a TWR concept engineering simulator and a completed core concept design for a TWR prototype program.  

Through simple market forces, technological advancement, and government investment reaching zero emissions from energy production is an incredibly achievable goal. We just need to point ourselves toward the finish line and start running.  

<h1>Construction and Manufacturing</h1>
Many construction and manufacturing methods involve heating materials to incredibly high temperatures. These processes can result in large greenhouse gas emissions. The process of making cement clinkers, an intermediary product in cement manufacturing, [produces 5% of global man made CO2 emissions](https://web.archive.org/web/20070714085318/http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/1IBetslPgkEie83rTa0J/cement-action-plan.pdf). Industrial processes overall make up about a [fifth of greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data). Luckily, another Bill Gates backed startup, [Heliogen](https://heliogen.com/), has an advanced method of aligning arrays of mirrors at a tower to heat materials to temperatures of up to 1500 degrees celcius. This can be used foor calcining, reforming, ore roasting, and sintering, processes which are vital for cement and steel manufacturing.  


One of the largest uses for cement and steel is in constructing buildings. Almost all of our high rises are made using large amounts of concrete and steel. But just as solar power is now cost-competitive with oil and gas, another construction material is becoming highly competitive with traditional ones. [Mass timber](https://carbonremoval.economist.com/mass-timber/) swaps out concrete and steel for prefabricated solid wood panels. Not only is this material [lighter, more durable, seismically resistance, fire resistance](https://www.oregon.gov/ODF/Documents/ForestBenefits/Beck-mass-timber-market-analysis-report.pdf), [cheaper, and up to 25% faster to build with,](https://www.awc.org/pdf/education/des/ReThinkMag-DES610A-MassTimberinNorthAmerica-161031.pdf) it's also significantly better for the environment. Since it's less sensitive too temperature changes, mass timber structures are [more energy efficient](https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrp/fpl_rp702.pdf). It's also predicted that using mass timber foor 90% of new urban buildings would [reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by eight billioon tons by 2050](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0462-4)(this doesn't take into account the adoption of technologies like Heliogen's). We've already seen some of mass timber's success in buldings like the HoHo Wien, a _twenty-four_ story tall mass timber building in Austria, and dozens of other shorter midrise and low highrise constructions throughout Europe and the United States. However, mass timber constructions require an alternate approval process under the International Building Code(IBC) which made them more difficult to build. Luckily for us, that just changed.  

In 2019 the International Code Council [approved proposals to allow tall wood buildings](https://www.woodworks.org/wp-content/uploads/wood_solution_paper-TALL-WOOD.pdf) as part of the 2021 International Building Code. A tall wood building is a building constructed primarily from mass timber materials instead of steel. This update to the IBC would standardize the different types of tall wood buildings with varying but limited amounts of steel framing or other supports. One allowed building type would be eighteen stories tall with an average of 64,000 square feet per story. This standardization will make mass timber construction significantly easier and cheaper, so we can expect to see more and more of them go up starting soon.
