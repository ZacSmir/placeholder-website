title: "The Solution Space is Very Large: A Case for Optimism Given Sufficient Political Will"

This has been a pretty shitty year and sometimes it feels like the prelude to an even shittier next few decades. The United States faces almost unprecedented inequality and the whole world is dealing with the initial consequences of climate change, a process we're still accelerating. At the same time other forms of ecological and social pillaging continue with no end in sight.  

This might seem like a weird way to start a post about optimism and solutioons, but this post is only conditionally optimistic. It's optimistic _if_ we can fix the United States' political dysfunction. And that's a pretty big if.  

But if we get goood political outcomes, if Ossoff and Warnock win Georgia, if progressives and the left get more power in the Democratic party, if more saints like Stacey Abrams and Ben Wikler can set up get-out-the-vote machines in other states, for local as well as federal elections, if not even all, but enough of those things happen, we have many causes for optimism.  

That's because the colossal problems we face aren't intractable. Not even close. This post is primarily a collection of solutions to the problems that we face as a country and a planet, primarily ecological and climate change related solutions, but welfare and inequality focused solutions as well.  

Think of this post like the bit from the Simpsons where Homer covers up the sign that says "Don't forget. you're here forever" with pictures of his daughter so that it says "do it for her." Where "it" is fighting the much, much harder political fights that need to be fought so we can enact the solutions we have.

<h1>Agriculture</h1>
The initial inspiration for this post came to me months ago from a [thread](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1273338423055704064) by [Dr. Sara Taber](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww) on "well managed wild game/fisheries." It turns out that managing "wild" herds of animals or salmon runs could provide so much more food and remove cities' dependency on rural areas for food. This could greatly reduce agricultural pollution as well.  

The most amazing part of all of this is that it isn't even necessarily a solution that we need to do a lot of intense research on to figure out how to use properly. It was done by Native Americans for thousands of years! And are still doing it!

Obviously the world would be a better place if we all became vegans, but if demand for meat is going to continue, we might as well try to make it more sustainable. That's where this next solution comes into play. Livestock contributes to [14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221209631730027X). Luckily, a [study a few years back](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652619321559) found that feeding cows seaweed reduces their methane emissions 67%! This massive reduction could be world-changing if enough seaweed can be sourced. Luckily even that logistics problem has a solution. [Research is being conducted](https://civileats.com/2019/06/03/can-we-grow-enough-seaweed-to-help-cows-fight-climate-change/) in both researching the most efficient ways to grow large amounts of seaweed, an already cost effective and low impact because it doesn't require feed and can clean the water, and on finding alternatives. I highly reccomend taking a closer look at the last article I just linked for more details.  
Interestingly, farmers in 18th century Iceland and Ancient Greece [grazed their cows on beaches](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-eating-seaweed-can-help-cows-to-belch-less-methane). Since methane is a sign of inefficiency in a cow's digestive system, farmers might even embrace the use of seaweed additives in cow feed.  

<h1>Electricity</h1>
I finally got the motivation to write this post after some of [Noah Smith's](https://twitter.com/noahpinion) on technological progress, specifically as relates to the cost of solar power.
