<h4><i>Humanity faces many problems on a colossal scale with catastrophic consequences. Namely Climate Change. Terrifyingly, it seems like a large portion of the world doesn't have the will to do anything about these problems. Luckily there is a light at the end of the tunnel: if we were to get the political and social will to face our problems, we'd find that there are actually SO MANY POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS and we just have to try them out. This post is a list of some of them to give you the hope and optimist to keep fighting.</i></h4>

The inspiration for this post came to me months ago from a [thread](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1273338423055704064) by [Dr. Sara Taber](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww) on "well managed wild game/fisheries." It turns out that managing "wild" herds of animals or salmon runs could provide so much more food and remove cities' dependency on rural areas for food. This could greatly reduce agricultural pollution as well.

The most amazing part of all of this is that it isn't even necessarily a solution that we need to do a lot of intense research on to figure out how to use properly. It was done by Native Americans for thousands of years! And are still doing it!

As I continued too read about agriculture, urban planning, green energy, and various welfare systems, I realized that even if not every potential solution will work, there are so, so, _so_ many solutions to our problems, and we just have to be willing to try them. So here's a by no means complete list of some of the myriad solutions to the problems that face both humanity as a whole and the United States:

<h3>Agriculture</h3>

<h3>Electricity</h3>

<h3>Transit</h3>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<h3>Carbon Sequestration</h3>

<h3>Poverty</h3>
